### An Untapped Clone (https://untappd.com/)

Uncappd is a social media application that allows users to publicly share beers and their reviews, of which can be viewed by other users/friends.

## Getting Started

The process of completing this clone looks like this:
1. Pick a complicated website of which you can completely program within 10 days
2. Mimic as many complex features as possible 
3. Site should be completely styled and free of bugs
4. Complete this project using the knowledge gained at App Academy

### Prerequisites

* MVP Checklist
* Database schema
* Sample State
* Frontend routes and components
* Backend Routes
* All other design docs

### Purpose

To demostrate my comprehension and rentention over the technologies taught at App Academy.
This project will be built with;

* HTML/CSS
* Javascript
* React/Redux
* Ruby/Rails
* PosgreSQL database
* Hosted on Heroku
* VS Code editor

### Key Features and Page Break Down

The core feature of this app is to add reviews on different beers that you have tried.
Each review includes information on the user, the beer, the brewery that made the beer, then venue the beer was drank at, a comment from the user, a rating on the beer, and a photo of the beer.

This app pushed my limits of social app knowledge and showed me how complicated sites can get when almost all of the information is shared across everything else. 

I would have to say I am most proud of the styling on this site. I dedicated a good portion of my time to replicate the original site as closley as possible. Some items are slightly off due to other features still being developed, but for the most part, you would have a hard time determining my site from the real thing. That also involves a logo that is almost indistinguishable from the real thing.

### Work in Progress

There are still many features that needed to be fully integrated and brought into the site.
